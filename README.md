Clicking on 'homepage.php' will start the program's full functionality of the project.

The project iterates through multiple dump-data students and their levels of completion of each of their degrees. The students will be able to review their requirements, know the status of their courses either from the past, present, or future, and tailor their degree goals with their advisor in a clean and organized fashion.
